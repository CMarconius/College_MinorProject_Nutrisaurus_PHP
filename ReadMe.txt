I based the design of this website (as close as possible) on the Image provided by the designers in my Group.
The file I was given is the 'Designers Original layout.png' file.

The file 'ns_site_db.sql' needs to be imported to PhpMyAdmin.
	
I have a working version running on the college provided web hosting.
You can see it at http://site542.webelevate.net/NutriSaurus/

I would also like to apolagise for being 4 hours late for the submission.
	
Thanks.
